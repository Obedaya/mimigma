## Introduction

Mimigma allows you to emulate different variants of the Enigma machine, including M1, M3, and Norway. With this tool, you can choose between various rotors and reflectors, set the rotors, ring settings, reflectors, and configure the plugboard. You also have the capability to save the state of your settings and import/export them for later use. Additionally, Mimigma supports user authentication and session state management. Users can be added or removed inside a configuration file, making it a collaborative and flexible solution.
